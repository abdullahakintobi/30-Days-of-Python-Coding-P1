# Solution
i = 4
d = 4.0
s = 'HackerRank '
# Declare second integer, double, and String variables.
j = 12
e = 4.0
t = 'is the best place to learn and practice coding!'
# Read and save an integer, double, and String to your variables.
k = i + j
f = d + e
u = s + t
# Print the sum of both integer variables on a new line.
print(k)
# Print the sum of the double variables on a new line.
print(f)
# Concatenate and print the String variables on a new line
# The 's' variable above should be printed first.
print(u)
